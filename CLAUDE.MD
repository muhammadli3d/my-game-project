# Project Overview

This is a Unity game development learning project focused on custom shader development using HLSL (High-Level Shading Language).

## Technology Stack

- **Game Engine**: Unity
- **Shader Language**: HLSL (High-Level Shading Language)
- **Testing**: Python scripts

## Project Goals

This is a learning project focused on:
1. Understanding Unity's rendering pipeline
2. Writing custom shaders in HLSL
3. Experimenting with shader effects and techniques

## Development Guidelines

### Shader Development
- Shaders are written in HLSL and stored in the `Shaders/` directory
- Follow Unity's shader conventions and best practices
- Test shaders thoroughly for performance and visual quality

### Code Style
- Use clear, descriptive naming for shader properties and functions
- Comment complex shader logic for learning purposes
- Keep shaders modular and reusable where possible

## Current State

The project currently contains:
- A basic HLSL shader template in `Shaders/BasicShader.hlsl`
- A Python test script for project validation

## Working with This Project

When making changes:
1. New shaders should be added to the `Shaders/` directory
2. Follow HLSL syntax and Unity shader conventions
3. Test changes with the Python test script when applicable
4. Document any new shader techniques or effects

## Notes for Claude

- This is a learning/educational project
- Focus on clear explanations when implementing shader features
- Prioritize readability and educational value over performance optimization (unless specifically requested)
- When adding new shaders, explain the techniques being used
